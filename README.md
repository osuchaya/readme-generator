## Description

This project is part of module 9 on Node.js where the author has to use Command Line Interface (CLI) with Node.js and inquirer package to dynamically generate a professional README markdown file by prompting the user to input information. 


## Installation

Install Node version 16.0 in order to run this application successfully.

## Usage

After cloning the code files into local machine, run  node index.js. This will initiate the prompts to input information. Follow the prompts and answer all the questions. Once completed, a README markdown file will be generated, populated with the information the user has put in.

## License

This project is currently under MIT license. However, the README markdown generated from this project allows for options choose other license.

## Learning points
The author learned to implement what is learnt during Node.js module and executing JavaScript functions through Command Line Interface. 
Through this exercise, the author also learned to use node package manager (npm) to install inquirer and use inquirer function to ask for
user input. Other useful functions such as writeToFile and path to store the file generated is also implemented in this project. It has
been a very useful introductory project to the back-end environment for my web development course.

## Credits
Resources were consulted to complete this application. This includes documents from https://nodejs.org and https://npmjs.com (relevant version) and tutor who helped to explain writeToFile functions to execute and enhance my understanding of the module from which this project is based upon.
